# NavAble

NavAble is an accessibility-first campus navigation system designed for the University of Washington.
It supports students, faculty, and visitors with diverse mobility and sensory needs by providing
personalized pedestrian routing, real-time safety context, and inclusive campus features.


## Problem Statement
How can the University of Washington better visualize and communicate on-campus accessibility challenges so that students, faculty, and visitors can rely on a centralized, device-compatible map to navigate campus safely, independently, and inclusively?


## Project Overview
NavAble extends existing mapping tools with accessibility-aware routing and UW-specific data
integration. The system prioritizes pedestrian needs and incorporates safety alerts, inclusive
facilities, and campus infrastructure data.

## Key Features
- Accessibility-aware pedestrian routing
- Integration with UW Alerts for safety context
- Support for multiple accessibility needs, including mobility and sensory considerations
- Inclusive campus points of interest such as gender-neutral restrooms

## Data Sources
- UW Campus Map
- UW Emergency Management (UW Alerts)
- UW Sidewalks Schema
- Google Maps / Elevation APIs

## Ethics & Privacy
NavAble is designed with privacy-preserving principles. The system does not store personal disability
data and prioritizes transparency, consent, and accessibility best practices throughout development.
